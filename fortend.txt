there is a  request sent to the server with http protocol and as every website has a unique ip address this request is met by the server and in the response server sends that unique ip address of website  to the frontend.

firstly web client establishes connection with server using TCP/IP protocol that means client sends request as HTTP msg .On the other side Server process the request & sends response back to the client in HTTP form.

As one enters google.com, the web browsers send the requests to the server. First the servers goes to DNS to fetch the google.com IP and then it sends it to browser and then the browser goes to the respective IP server, where the server response the request and send the required html/css/js files to the client/ browser

it automatically add up the HTTP protocol in the beginning of the URL.

browser checks DNS(it's like a database which maintains name and ip address). 
Then the browser sends an HTTP request
Then the server responds.

The browser sents the request to sever though proxies in between . Then the browser use it's high lvl architecture which consists of networking, rendering engine, ui backend engine to display the web page.
